**Web Development** is a branch of Computer Science that deals with the development of a Website or a Web Application that run on the Internet. The process of web development can be divided into two main categories — **Front-End Web Development** and **Back-End Web Development**. The combination of both is known as **Full-Stack Web Development**.

-------------------------------------------------

**FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT :-**

The Front-End Web Development is the **Client-Side Programming**, that the user interacts with. It involves **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX)**.
The core programming languages that are used in front-end web development are **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

- HTML is used for building the basic structure / layout of a web page.
- CSS is used for designing that web page.
- JavaScript is used for adding functionalities on that web page.

**Frameworks & Libraries :**
- CSS — Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, etc.
- JavaScript — React JS, Angular JS, Vue JS, etc.

-------------------------------------------------

_After Front-End & before Back-End, comes the concept of **Application Programming Interface (API)**, which acts as a bridge and allows communication between the two, i.e., it connects the front-end with the back-end._

-------------------------------------------------

**BACK-END WEB DEVELOPMENT :-**

The Back-End Web Development is the **Server-Side Programming**, that the user cannot interact with. It involves **Server**, **Database** and **Algorithms**.
There are many programming languages that can be used in back-end development like **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, **Ruby**, etc.

**Frameworks & Libraries :**
- JavaScript — Express JS, Nest JS, etc.
- Python — Django, Flask, etc.
- Java — Spring Boot, Jakarta EE, etc.
- C++ — CppCMS, Crow, etc.
- Ruby — Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, etc.

**Runtime Environments (to run the back-end server) :**
- JavaScript — Node JS
- Python — Python Interpreter (CPython)
- Java — Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- C++ — Compiled Native Code
- Ruby — Ruby Interpreter (Ruby MRI)

**Databases :**
1. **Relational / SQL Databases —** store data in tables with rows and columns. Example — MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.
2. **Non-Relational / NoSQL —** store data in various formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. Example — MondoDB, Redis, Amazon Neptune, etc.

-------------------------------------------------

**DEPLOYMENT OF A WEBSITE :-**

Once a website is developed, the final step is **Deployment** — making it accessible on the Internet.
Deployment involves hosting the website on a server, connecting it to a domain name and setting up a database.

Here’s an overview of the deployment process :
1. **Choose A Hosting Platform :**
- For front-end only : GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.
- For back-end only : Render, Railway, Fly.io, etc.
- For full-stack (both front-end & back-end) : Amazon Web Services (AWS), DigitalOcean, Supabase, etc.

2. **Purchase A Domain Name :** Example: “yourwebsite.com” from registrars like Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.

3. **Set Up A Database :** If a website uses a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), set it up on a hosting provider or use managed database services like MongoDB Atlas, Firebase, AWS RDS, etc.

Apart from all these, one should also have good knowledge about some theoretical subjects like — **Internet Structure**, **Computer Networking**, **Operating Systems**, **Version Control Systems**, **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, etc.

**FINAL THOUGHTS :-**

Web Development is a vast and evolving field that combines creativity, logic, and problem-solving. From designing interactive front-end interfaces to managing powerful back-end servers, each step adds value to your skill set. Learning web development might seem challenging at first, but remember, every expert once started with **“Hello World!”**.
Whether you want to build personal projects, freelance, or become a professional developer, this roadmap gives you a direction to start your journey. The more you practice, the better you’ll understand how the web truly works.
Keep learning, keep experimenting, and most importantly — keep building.
